Bigger Number Wins is a game inspired by a popular mobile adds where the player cannot distinguish the larger number. In our version, we have added a roguelike element to make the gameplay more interesting and challenging. Currently, the game does not have graphics.

## Gameplay

In the game, the player must choose the larger of two numbers. Choosing the larger number allows the game to continue, while choosing the smaller one ends the game. Additionally, on each level, the player may encounter various obstacles and enemies, adding a strategic element to the game. The roguelike elements include randomness and the choice of changing the number from three possible options.
